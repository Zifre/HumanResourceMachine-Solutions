# HumanResourceMachine-Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the PC game Human Resource Machine. This are solutions that
I used on my own run of this game. Each file has the number and name of the particular level that
its solves, in addition to the type of attribute that the solutions tries to optimize. Take the
following example:

    02.busy_mail_room-size.hrm
    02.busy_mail_room-speed.hrm

Means that the level 02.busy_mail_room has two solutions, one optimized for size, and another one
optimized for speed. On the contrary if one has the following:

    01.mail_room.hrm

This means that this particular solution achieves both speed and size at the same time (as peer the
game own challenge standard).
